Hello, I am Nanduni!

I am currently working as a Postdoctoral Research Fellow with the [School of Engineering](https://eng.anu.edu.au/) at [The Australian National University](https://www.anu.edu.au/). My research interests are in the areas of Power Systems and Optimization with a focus on both the theoretical and practical aspects of controlling and coordinating distributed energy sources within power grids.

My research involves developing algorithms for various applications in the context of smart grids, electric vehicles, battery storage, grid integration of renewables including solar PV, and resilience enhancement in microgrids. Specifically, my overarching research goal is to assist distribution grids deal with low-carbon technologies such as electric vehicles through optimisation models. 

I received the Ph.D. in Engineering and Computer Science from [The Australian National University](https://www.anu.edu.au/) in collaboration with the [Information Security and Privacy Research Group](https://research.csiro.au/isp/) at the [Data61, CSIRO](https://data61.csiro.au/), where I focused on Electric Vehicle (EV)-assisted Demand Side Management in Smart Grid. During my PhD, I also worked as a tutor with the [School of Computer Science](https://www.sydney.edu.au/engineering/schools/school-of-computer-science.html) at [The University of Sydney](https://www.sydney.edu.au/). Prior to doing Ph.D., I worked as a Software Engineer at the [Sysco LABS Sri Lanka](https://www.syscolabs.com/).
