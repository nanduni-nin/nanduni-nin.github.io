Hello, I am Nanduni!

I am currently a Postdoctoral Research Fellow with the [School of Electrical, Mechanical and Infrastructure Engineering](https://eng.unimelb.edu.au/about/departments/school-of-electrical-mechanical-and-infrastructure-engineering) at [The University of Melbourne, Australia](https://www.unimelb.edu.au/) and a Research Affiliate with the [Australian Centre for Robotics
](https://www.sydney.edu.au/engineering/our-research/robotics-and-intelligent-systems/australian-centre-for-robotics.html) at [The University of Sydney, Australia](https://www.sydney.edu.au/). My current research involves Power and Energy Optimization in Smart Grids with a focus on both the theoretical and practical aspects of controlling and coordinating distributed energy resources (DERs).

Specifically, my research interests lie in Applied Mathematics, Optimisation and Control, Economics, and Machine Learning to solve challenging engineering problems in various contexts, particularly in energy and power systems. I have extensive research experience in developing algorithmic solutions for various applications in the smart grid, including but not limited to electric vehicles, battery storage, resilience enhancement in microgrids, and grid integration of renewables such as solar PV. My overarching research goal is to assist distribution grids to deal with challenges underlying the increasing adoption of DERs, with a major focus on the safety and resilience of distribution grids. My role as a Research Fellow also involves Teaching and PhD student co-supervision.


I received the Ph.D. in Engineering and Computer Science from [The Australian National University, Australia](https://www.anu.edu.au/) in collaboration with the [Information Security and Privacy Research Group](https://research.csiro.au/isp/) at the [Data61, CSIRO, Australia](https://data61.csiro.au/). I subsequently held a Postdoctoral Research Fellow position with [The Australian National University, Australia](https://www.anu.edu.au/). Prior to pursuing the Ph.D., I worked as a Software Engineer.

<!-- During my PhD, I also worked as a tutor with the [School of Computer Science](https://www.sydney.edu.au/engineering/schools/school-of-computer-science.html) at [The University of Sydney](https://www.sydney.edu.au/).  -->
