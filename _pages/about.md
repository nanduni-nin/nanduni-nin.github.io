Hello, I am Nanduni!

I am currently a Postdoctoral Research Fellow with the [School of Engineering](https://eng.anu.edu.au/) at [The Australian National University](https://www.anu.edu.au/). My research interests lie in the areas of Power Systems and Optimization with a focus on both the theoretical and practical aspects of controlling and coordinating distributed energy resources (DERs) within power grids.

Specifically, my research involves developing algorithms for various applications in the context of smart grids, including but not limited to electric vehicles, battery storage, resilience enhancement in microgrids, and grid integration of renewables such as solar PV. My overarching research goal is to assist distribution grids to deal with challenges underlying the increasing adoption of DERs, with major focus on the safety and resilience of distribution grids.

I received the Ph.D. in Engineering and Computer Science from [The Australian National University](https://www.anu.edu.au/), in collaboration with the [Information Security and Privacy Research Group](https://research.csiro.au/isp/) at the [Data61, CSIRO, Australia](https://data61.csiro.au/). During my PhD, I also worked as a tutor with the [School of Computer Science](https://www.sydney.edu.au/engineering/schools/school-of-computer-science.html) at [The University of Sydney](https://www.sydney.edu.au/). Prior to Ph.D., I worked as a Software Engineer at the [Sysco LABS Sri Lanka](https://www.syscolabs.com/).
