* ### Doctoral Research: Electric Vehicle (EV)-assisted Demand Side Management in Smart Grid

My PhD research focused on the development of optimization-based control approaches to enable seamless Electric Vehicle (EV) grid integration. Major contributions included several demand-side algorithmic approaches for coordinating residential EV charging and discharging, with emphasis on customer satisfaction, energy cost minimization, safe and reliable distribution network operation, and distributed coordination. A Thesis titled 'Electric Vehicle-Assisted Demand-Side Management in Smart Grid' and five refereed publications (in Q1 journals based on the Scimago Journal Rankings) resulted from this research.
